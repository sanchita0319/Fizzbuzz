# Fizzbuzz

# Overview
This fizzbuz game is my first Alexa skill. I began building this by starting with the Hello World Alexa skill template and then watching the Zero to Hero Alexa Developer Series on youtube. Since the invocation name fizz buzz was already taken, the invocation name for this skill is "Fizz Buzz New Edition." In addition to the required functionality of counting from onne and saying fizz, buzz, or fizzbuzz, this game has a high score functionality where it keeps track of the highest number a user has ever reached. It also has support for common phrases, like Repeat, Help (states instructions), Stop, and for Invalid input. The repeat function repeats the last reponse when used with the help function. This is to help the user in resuminng the game. 

# Version History

First Iteration: I built the basic game where alexa was able to respond to input and verify the correct value (number, fizz, or buzz)

Second Iteration: I added the high score functionality using the persistence attributes to keep track of the highest number a user has reached.

Third Iteration: Cleaned code by adding compatibility for multiple languages and added functions to calculate correct response. Added more comments explaining the code.

Fourth Iteration: Separated code into different files to improve readability.
